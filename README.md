## ðŸ“Œ Project 1 â€“ Buenos Aires Housing Price Prediction  

### ðŸ“„ Summary  
A complete workflow from **data preprocessing** to **price prediction modeling**, designed to identify market trends and factors influencing property prices.  

### ðŸ“‚ Contents  
- **Buenos Aires Housing Price Prediction.ipynb** â€“ Main Jupyter Notebook containing all data preparation, exploratory analysis, visualization, and model building steps.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Explore the Buenos Aires housing market dataset.  
- Identify key price-driving features such as location, size, and amenities.  
- Build regression models to predict property prices.  
- Present findings through static and interactive visualizations.

### ðŸ“‚ Contents  
- **Buenos Aires Housing Price Prediction â€“ Advanced EDA & Modeling.ipynb** â€“ Extended notebook with richer data exploration, advanced model building, and an interactive property price estimator.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform deeper exploratory data analysis using advanced visualizations.  
- Experiment with multiple regression techniques for improved predictions.  
- Provide an **interactive tool** to estimate property prices based on user inputs (works locally in Jupyter).  

### ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Scikit-learn  
- ipywidgets (for interactivity)  

### ðŸ“Š Methodology  
1. Advanced data cleaning & feature engineering.  
2. Detailed EDA with multi-variable visualizations.  
3. Model comparison using multiple algorithms.  
4. Development of an interactive widget-based price estimator.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights  
- **Location Variables:** Crucial in boosting prediction accuracy.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features to capture property characteristics more effectively.  
- **Interactive Estimator:** Allows on-the-fly property price prediction when run in a Jupyter environment.
